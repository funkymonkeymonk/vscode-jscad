# Unsorted TODOs

TODO:
- debouncing to reduce frequency of view updates
- send global error messages to VSCode console instead of displaying them inside the "red box"
- improve command handling and converter integration
- do not show empty view when no file is loaded (maybe show some preload/waiting content instead)
-

IDEAS:
- visually highlight currently edited shape (maybe by injecting a setColor statement into the code passed to setJsCad? would require parsing the JSCAD code, though)
