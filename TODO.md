# Unsorted TODOs

TODO:
- send global error messages to VSCode console instead of displaying them inside the "red box"
- fix inital view state (properly handle JSCADPreviewPanel.onInitialize)
- improve command handling and converter integration
- fix icon hover effects

IDEAS:
- visually highlight currently edited shape (maybe by injecting a setColor statement into the code passed to setJsCad? would require parsing the JSCAD code, though)
