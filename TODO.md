# Roughly sorted TODOs

TODO:
- do not re-render view after text cursor movement or selection changes
- improve command handling and converter integration
- fix viewer background for other theme colors
- send global error messages to VSCode console instead of displaying them inside the "red box"
- do not show empty view when no file is loaded (maybe show some preload/waiting content instead)
- improve Intellisense
- improve options panel for parametric models (show on semi-transparent layer)

IDEAS:
- visually highlight currently edited shape (maybe by injecting a setColor statement into the code passed to setJsCad? would require parsing the JSCAD code, though)
- Snippets Library with common shapes
